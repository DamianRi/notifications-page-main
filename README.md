## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) + [vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

### What I learned

I practiced how to create some components in Vue 3.
But my main problem was how to deploy my project on github pages. If you have some similar problems, you could visit this [docs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory) or one solution from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68758939/github-pages-vite-js-build-not-showing-the-images)

### Continued development

More vite configurations and more deployments with this technology
